# EQ-live
Jupyter notebooks for demonstration, exploration and prototyping of Effective Quadratures.

# Running on the cloud via Azure
The notebooks in this repo can be run on the cloud (for free!) by going [here](https://notebooks.azure.com/ascillitoe/projects/eq-live) and cloning the Azure notebooks project. Click on the Jupyter notebook you wish to run, select "Python 3.6" as the kernel, and Azure will then load the neccesary dependencies from the requirements.txt file. 

*Note*: Initialising the kernel and loading the dependencies (such as the `equadratures` and `matplotlib` python packages) may take some time, especially when using "Free Compute" resources. Keep an eye on the grey dot in the top right corner, when it goes clear the kernel is "Idle" and you're good to go. For this reason it is recommended that you do not restart the kernel (or rerun the package import cell) when interacting notebooks unless you really need to.
